# Power Electricity Trading Algorithm

## Overview

This project implements a power electricity trading algorithm using advanced machine learning techniques, including LSTM for price forecasting and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for deep reinforcement learning-based trading strategies.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/power_trading_algorithm.git
   cd power_trading_algorithm
2.	Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Python installed (preferably 3.7 or higher). Install the required Python packages using pip:
pip install -r requirements.txt
3.	Data Preprocessing
Generate synthetic data and perform feature engineering:
python data_preprocessing.py
This will create a processed_data.csv file in the project directory.
4.	LSTM Price Forecasting
Train the LSTM model for price prediction:
python lstm_forecasting.py
This script will train the model and save it as lstm_price_forecast_model.h5 along with the scaler as scaler.save.
5.	Deep Reinforcement Learning Training
Train the PPO agent for trading:
python drl_training.py
The trained model will be saved as ppo_power_trading.zip.
6.	Evaluate the Trading Strategy
Evaluate the performance of the trained DRL agent:
python drl_evaluation.py
This will plot the portfolio balance over time and display the final balance.
Notes
•	Synthetic Data: The project uses synthetic data for demonstration purposes. For real-world applications, replace the data generation part with actual electricity market data.
•	Model Saving and Loading: Ensure that models are saved and loaded correctly. The drl_evaluation.py script assumes that ppo_power_trading.zip exists in the project directory.
•	Computational Resources: Training deep learning models and DRL agents can be computationally intensive. It's recommended to use a machine with a GPU for faster training.
Further Enhancements
•	Real Data Integration: Integrate real-time data sources for more accurate and realistic trading scenarios.
•	Advanced Models: Experiment with more sophisticated models like Transformer-based architectures for forecasting and other RL algorithms.
•	Risk Management: Implement advanced risk management strategies to handle market volatility and potential losses.
•	Deployment: Develop a deployment pipeline to run the trading algorithm in a live environment with real-time data feeds.

## How to Create the Zip Archive

1. **Create the Project Directory**

   Create a directory named `power_trading_algorithm` and navigate into it:

   ```bash
   mkdir power_trading_algorithm
   cd power_trading_algorithm
2.	Add the Files
o	Create each file (data_preprocessing.py, lstm_forecasting.py, etc.) and paste the corresponding code provided above into each file.
o	Create the requirements.txt and README.md files with the provided content.
3.	Organize Files
Ensure all files are correctly placed within the power_trading_algorithm directory.
4.	Zip the Directory
Navigate to the parent directory and create a zip archive:
cd ..
zip -r power_trading_algorithm.zip power_trading_algorithm/
This command creates a power_trading_algorithm.zip file containing all the project files.
Additional Tips
•	Version Control: Consider using Git for version control. Initialize a Git repository within the project directory and commit your changes. This also allows you to push the project to platforms like GitHub for easier sharing and collaboration.
•	cd power_trading_algorithm
•	git init
•	git add .
•	git commit -m "Initial commit of power trading algorithm project"
•	Virtual Environment: It's good practice to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
•	python -m venv env
•	source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
•	pip install -r requirements.txt
•	License File: If you plan to share the project publicly, consider adding a LICENSE file to specify the usage terms.
